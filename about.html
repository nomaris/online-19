        <h2>ABOUT</h2>

        <div></div>

        <p>This is an online space for projects that were created during the time of the COVID-19 security quarantine measures. The idea of this online space stemmed from an interest to have a look into people's interests beyond that of what is expected from us in the economic system we exist. Meaning that a person is valueable and that their value is not dependent on their monetary "success".</p>

        <p>Of course we cannot ignore the priviledge that it is to <b>have</b> time even when it seems like everyone has it these days that is not the reality for all people. For some, moving to online workspaces has been a breeze, a small bump in the road. For others, it means to confront head first systematic roadblocks that are tied to centuries worth of oppresion. So beyond these projects, we must reflect on what we have that makes it possible to live a life online that others don't have the access to, and what it means not just now but beyond the crisis. This online space is a look into what people do when they are able to exist outside of their economic needs.</p>
