      <p>Nomaris Garcia Rivera is a college student majoring in Journalism + Design at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts. She has always had a great appreciation of art and in the past she has taken a couple of courses to learn and develop skills, however she generally doesn't have much time to make her own. As her free time extended, between her online classes she has re-explored that interest and has taken on painting.</p>
